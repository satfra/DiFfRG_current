       * Only the Kurganov-Tadmor assembler consults this. KT adds a dissipation term
       * -a/2 (u^+ - u^-) to the numerical flux of every component, with `a` a wave speed read off
       * the flux jacobian. Which jacobian, and whether a component is dissipated at all, is what
       * this declares: components sharing a block id share one speed, computed as the spectral
       * radius of the flux jacobian *restricted to that block*, and a component marked
       * `no_wave_speed` is not dissipated.
       *
       * Two things go wrong when the whole system shares one speed, and a model that mixes a
       * conservation law with constraints needs both fixed.
       *
       * A component whose flux is identically zero is dissipated all the same. For a differential
       * component that is harmless: its diagonal carries c_j * JxW, which swamps the dissipation. An
       * algebraic component has no such term, so the dissipation becomes the leading entry of its
       * row -- and drags the reconstruction's slope limiter into the newton jacobian with it, where
       * a limiter kink stalls the iteration outright. `no_wave_speed` drops the dissipation instead,
       * leaving the row exactly as the model wrote it.
       *
       * A component that *does* carry a flux, but a much slower one than the fastest in the system,
       * is over-dissipated by the ratio of the two speeds. That is worse than inaccurate when the
       * row is algebraic. Its own terms are integrated over the cell and so carry a factor of the
       * cell width, while the dissipation is a face quantity and does not; the row's diagonal
       * dominance is then O(dx) and the row *degenerates under refinement*, so the scheme fails when
       * the grid is made finer. Giving such a component its own block restores the balance: both the
       * diagonal and the off-diagonal scale as a/dx and their difference stays finite.
       *
       * Blocking is a statement that the cross-couplings between blocks do not carry characteristics
       * -- true when the off-block rows are constraints rather than conservation laws, which is the
       * case this exists for. It is not a licence to split a genuinely hyperbolic system, where the
       * full spectral radius is the safe choice and is what one block gives.
       *
       * This is a structural property of the model, not a function of the state: it is queried per
       * face, and blocks that varied with the solution would be both a cost and a discontinuity.
