  /**
   * @brief A read-only, fully-replicated view of the solution.
   *
   * A large amount of code under discretization/ reads the solution at *arbitrary global dof
   * indices*: the EoM search (common/eom.hh), the KT reconstruction caches
   * (FV/assembler/reconstruction_cache.hh), the output path (data/fe_output.cc) and the support
   * point lookups. None of that is expressible against a vector that only holds this rank's rows.
   *
   * Rather than rewrite all of it, this class maintains one replica holding *every* index,
   * refreshed once per residual/Jacobian evaluation. Those call sites then read the replica and
   * need no logic change at all. At replicated-mesh sizes the replica is exactly today's memory
   * footprint.
   *
   * The serial specialization is a pure passthrough -- it stores a pointer, copies nothing, and
   * compiles to the same code as passing the vector directly -- so a serial build pays nothing for
   * the abstraction.
   *
   * @warning The two policies differ in one respect that matters if you hold a view across a
   * write: the serial view aliases the source vector, so it observes later mutations, while the
   * distributed view is a snapshot taken at refresh(). Always refresh() immediately before reading
   * and never hold a view across an assembly step, and the two behave identically.
   *
   * Narrowing the replica from "everything" to the locally relevant dofs is the defining step of
   * the fully-distributed rung. It is deliberately confined to this one class so that step has a
   * single place to happen, and so the call sites that will need real work are exactly the ones
   * that name this type.

   *
   * The replica lives on MPI_COMM_SELF and owns all n_dofs entries, refreshed by one MPI_Allgatherv
   * of the owning ranks' contiguous blocks.
   *
   * @warning It is tempting -- and it was the first implementation -- to build the replica as a
   * PETSc *ghosted* vector on the global communicator with complete_index_set() as its ghost set,
   * and let deal.II's step-40 assignment idiom do the communication. That is correct in a single
   * thread and crashes under assembly. deal.II's read path for a ghosted PETSc vector
   * (VectorBase::extract_subvector_to) calls VecGhostGetLocalForm / VecGhostRestoreLocalForm around
   * every read, and those two do PetscObjectReference / PetscObjectDereference on the local form
   * plus a PetscObjectStateSet on both vectors -- a non-atomic refcount and a shared write. Every
   * assembler reads the solution from inside a MeshWorker::mesh_loop cell worker, i.e. from N TBB
   * worker threads at once, so the refcount races; a lost increment takes it to zero, PETSc frees
   * the local form, and the next thread segfaults in VecGetSize_Seq on freed memory (the
   * accompanying "free(): invalid pointer" is the double free). PETSc is not thread safe unless
   * built --with-threadsafety.
   *
   * The non-ghosted read path does none of that -- VecGetOwnershipRange plus VecGetArrayRead and
   * pointer arithmetic, no refcount, no state write -- so a replica that owns everything locally is
   * both the simplest expression of "every rank holds every entry" and the only one that survives
   * threaded assembly.
