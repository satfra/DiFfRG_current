     *
     *  - `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`, which is what deal.II's `MultithreadInfo::n_cores()`

     *    with taskset, it still reports 32. So a rank pinned to its own cores does not know it.
     *  - Conversely, when a launcher *has* pinned each rank (Slurm `--cpus-per-task`), TBB's
     *    `default_concurrency()` does see the mask (8 in the same test), so the thread limit is
     *    already per-rank -- and dividing it again by the node-local rank count halves it a second
     *    time. On a 128-core node split into 2 pinned ranks that yields 32 threads each, not 64.
     *
     * So the divisor is not "how many ranks are on this node" but "how many node-local ranks are
     * competing for *my* CPUs". That is answered by intersecting the affinity masks, the same way
     * GPU sharing is answered by comparing bus ids rather than counting devices.
