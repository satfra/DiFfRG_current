# DiFfRG

**DiFfRG** (Discretization Framework for functional Renormalization Group flows)
is a C++20 scientific-computing library for solving fRG flow equations. It
provides spatial and temporal discretization of quantum field theory systems,
built on [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org/) (FEM),
[Kokkos](https://kokkos.org/) (GPU/CPU parallelization) and
[SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials) (implicit solvers).

The framework spans three languages, each documented under its own tab above:
