  /**
   * @brief Deferred landing of QuadratureIntegrator::map() results in host memory.
   *
   * Why this exists. `map()` used to finish with
   *
   *     Kokkos::deep_copy(space, dest_view, dest_device_view);
   *
   * where `dest_view` wraps caller memory — a `dealii::Vector` element range, i.e. ordinary
   * *pageable* host memory. A device-to-pageable `cudaMemcpyAsync` is not actually asynchronous:
   * the driver has to stage it, so the call blocks until the copy (and therefore the kernels
   * feeding it) has completed. Measured on a YangMills solve: `cudaMemcpyAsync` totalled 15.933 s
   * against 15.966 s of kernel time — the host sat inside that copy for essentially the entire
   * GPU execution. The consequence is that there is **zero host run-ahead**: the GPU drains after
   * every one of the ~3400 map() calls, and all host preparation for the next flow is exposed as
   * GPU idle time. On a part where the kernels are slow (an RTX 4070) that costs a few percent;
   * on one where they are ~6x faster (an A100) it is over half the wall clock.
   *
   * The fix is to copy into a *pinned* staging buffer instead, which really is asynchronous, and
   * to defer the final pinned->caller memcpy until someone needs the numbers. Integrators register
   * that pending copy here; `flush()` fences once and lands all of them together.
   *
   * Deferral is **opt-in and scoped**, via DeferredMaps. Outside such a scope `map()` keeps its
   * original contract — the result is in `dest` when it returns — so every existing caller (tests,
   * Examples, downstream models) is unaffected. That matters because the failure mode of a silent
   * contract change here is not a compile error but wrong numbers.
   *
   * Inside a DeferredMaps scope the caller promises not to read any `dest` until the scope ends
   * (or it calls flush_maps() itself). Use it around a run of *independent* flows.
   *
   * Not thread safe: the flow evaluation path is single-threaded (the parallelism lives inside the
   * Kokkos kernels), and this registry is only touched from it.
