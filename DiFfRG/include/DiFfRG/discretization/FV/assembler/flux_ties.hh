         * @brief The named tuple handed to model.flux().
         *
         * "extractors" and "variables" carry the same data the source() tuple does, filled once per
         * residual and once per jacobian by the assembler's extract() before any flux is evaluated.
         * They are plain NumberType even inside the AD-seeded flux loops, i.e. the flux jacobian does
         * not contain the dependence of an extractor on the FE solution -- the extractors are frozen
         * within a Newton step, exactly as they are for source(). A model that solves for something
         * at the EoM in extract() and reads it here therefore gets an approximate jacobian, which
         * costs Newton iterations rather than accuracy: the extraction is redone for every residual.
         *
         * "cell_width" is the local grid spacing: the width of the cell this trace was
         * reconstructed from, measured along the normal of the face being assembled. See
         * DiFfRG::internal::cell_width. It lets a model build a term whose size is set by the mesh
         * rather than by a parameter -- an upwind viscosity being the usual reason. Anything built
         * from it has to vanish as the mesh is refined, or the scheme it belongs to does not
         * converge.
         *
         * The slot order matches the FEM assemblers' fe_tie and this scheme's own fv_tie: the
         * discretization-specific solution entries first, then "extractors", "variables",
         * "cell_width".
