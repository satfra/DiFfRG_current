     * adapts to the hardware instead of being a constant tuned on one machine. That matters: the
     * measured fill threshold on the development GPU (5e4) is within 10% of its resident-thread

     * over-split by 4x on the very cluster this feature exists for.
     *
     * The two differ in more than magnitude. On the device `concurrency()` counts *resident threads*
     * and each thread evaluates the kernel once, so the fill threshold is the concurrency itself. On
     * the host it counts *workers*, each of which loops over many evaluations, so the threshold is
     * workers x a grain large enough that one parallel_for spawn (order 10 us) disappears into the
     * work it dispatches.

  /**
   * @brief Decides, without any user input, which rank computes which part of each map().
   *
   * ## What is split
   *
   * Only the **external** coordinate grid of a `map()` -- never a quadrature reduction. Every
   * individual integral is therefore still summed entirely on one rank, in the original order, so
   * the result is **bitwise identical to a serial run at any rank count**. That is not a nicety:
   * the flow kernels feed a stiff DAE (see common/tbb.hh), where a last-bit change in a residual
   * changes the accepted step sequence and hence the whole trajectory. It also makes rebalancing
   * numerically free -- moving a partition boundary changes *which* rank computes a point, never
   * *what* it computes.
   *
   * Splitting applies to grids of any dimension. `SubCoordinates` is a window into the *linear*
   * index range, matching `part()` above, so the split needs no per-axis structure; it used to
   * derive a per-axis box, which is the same set of points only for `dim == 1`, and multi-dimensional
   * grids were therefore assigned whole to a single rank. That mattered: the multi-angle vertex
   * flows are both the most expensive and the ones with multi-dimensional external grids.
   *
   * ## How the split is chosen
   *
   * Per call, with `G` external grid points and a quadrature volume `Q = prod(grid_size)`:
   *
   *     S = G * Q                                   (kernel evaluations in this map)
   *     r = clamp(S / quantum, 1, min(n_ranks, G))  (how many ranks to spread it over)
   *     owners = the r least-loaded ranks
   *
   * Inside a batch, `quantum` is the **fill threshold**, not a launch-overhead threshold: below
   * roughly 5e4 evaluations these register-heavy kernels do not occupy a modern device anyway, so
   * splitting further buys nothing and costs a launch plus a gather. Deriving it from launch cost
   * (~1e3 evaluations) would oversplit by two orders of magnitude.
   *
   * The practical consequence is the one that matters for load balance: a **cheap flow is assigned
   * whole** to the least-loaded rank rather than chopped into slivers, so a block of many small
   * flows spreads across ranks instead of every rank doing a sliver of every flow.
   *
   * That reasoning is an argument about *opportunity cost*, and it holds only while there are other
   * maps to take the ranks this one leaves out. Outside a `DeferredMaps` scope there are none:
   * `map()` flushes on return, so the map is the whole batch and every rank without a slice sits in
   * the `Allgatherv` until the owners finish. There the fill threshold gives away ranks for nothing,
   * and the threshold that applies is instead `internal::launch_threshold` -- a slice must still
   * cover the launch that computes it, and that is the only remaining constraint. `set_batched()`
   * is how the scheduler learns which case it is in. An explicit user override wins over both.
   *
   * ## Mixed device and host models
   *
   * A rank holds two independent resources -- its GPU and its share of the node's cores -- and both
   * `r` and the ownership choice are made against the one the calling integrator actually uses.
   * `r` follows from that space's fill threshold (a device is saturated by its resident threads, a
   * host by workers x a grain), and the slices are charged to a **separate per-resource budget**, so
   * a rank that has just taken a large TBB flow is still the natural home for the next GPU flow.
   *
   * That is what makes a model mixing `GPU_exec` and `TBB_exec` integrators use both at once rather
   * than merely correctly: within a `DeferredMaps` scope the device path launches asynchronously and
   * returns, so a host map issued after it runs concurrently with it, and each resource is levelled
   * across ranks on its own. What the budgets deliberately do *not* do is convert between the two --
   * there is no exchange rate at which a device evaluation equals a host one, and assuming one is
   * exactly the mistake a single shared budget makes.
   *
   * Two limits remain, and both are outside this class. Within one resource the weight per
   * evaluation is 1, so flows with equal `S` but different per-evaluation cost still mis-weigh
   * (calibration, plan stage 4). And the overlap only exists inside a deferral scope: a host map
   * issued with deferral off flushes -- and therefore synchronises every rank -- before the device
   * work behind it can catch up.
   *
   * ## Determinism
   *
   * Every rank runs the same program and issues the same sequence of `map()` calls, so a schedule
   * that is a pure function of that sequence is identical on all ranks without any communication.
   * The running per-rank load is part of that state and is reset by `complete()`. A plan checksum
   * is verified inside `complete()`; a mismatch aborts the job rather than hanging it.
   */
  /**
   * @brief A scope in which map() must not be called.
   *
   * map() is a collective: every rank must issue the same sequence of them. Distributed FE assembly
   * breaks that guarantee, because each rank visits only its own cells -- so a map() from inside a
   * cell worker is issued a different number of times on different ranks, and the run hangs in the
   * next Allgatherv with no indication of which model did it.
   *
   * The rule "no map() inside FE assembly" already existed as documentation. This makes it
   * enforceable: the assemblers open one of these around every mesh loop, and a map() inside aborts
   * the job with a message naming the problem instead of hanging.
   *
   * Deliberately a process-wide counter rather than thread_local: assembly runs cell workers on TBB
   * worker threads, and a thread_local flag set on the main thread would be invisible to exactly the
   * threads that need checking.
