  /**
   * @brief A process-local, serial mirror of a (possibly partitioned) triangulation.
   *
   * Returns @p source itself when it is already serial, so a serial build allocates nothing and
   * behaves exactly as before.
   *
   * Why this exists: at the replicated-mesh rung every rank holds the whole mesh and (through
   * SolutionView) the whole solution, so anything that only needs to *read* the mesh can and should
   * do so without communicating. But deal.II decides collectiveness from the triangulation's type,
   * not from what the caller intends:
   *
   *  * DoFHandler::distribute_dofs() on a parallel triangulation is collective.
   *  * MeshWorker::mesh_loop() visits only the calling rank's cells, and drops faces between two
   *    non-owned cells no matter which AssembleFlags are set.
   *  * DataOut::add_data_vector() routes every vector type through a ghosted
   *    LinearAlgebra::distributed::BlockVector built on dof_handler.get_mpi_communicator().
   *
   * Each of those is a hang or a silently truncated result when it runs inside a rank-0-only region
   * such as OutputSession's contributor. Handing that code a serial mirror makes all three local,
   * complete and identical on every rank.
   *
   * The mirror is cached and refreshed IN PLACE, and the stable address is load-bearing:
   * dealii::DataOut latches onto the triangulation of the first DoFHandler it is handed and never
   * lets go -- DataOut_DoFData::clear() resets `dofs` but leaves `triangulation` alone, and
   * add_data_vector only re-reads it while it is still null. A fresh mirror per call therefore
   * leaves the output pointing at a destroyed mesh, which surfaces much later as
   * ReferenceCell::get_default_linear_mapping() throwing ExcNotImplemented out of build_patches.
   *
   * Refreshed when the source mesh changes: the any_change signal covers refinement, coarsening and
   * clearing, and the size comparison covers a source we never managed to connect to.
